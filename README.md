# ActionRogueLike

This repo is my code and content submissions after each Lecture in the course "Professional Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine" by Tom Looman. I am specifically following the original course which was created for Unreal Engine 4.25 (but compatible with 4.26, 4.27, and 5.X with some adjustments). I am using Unreal Engine 5.6 for my code and that means I'm making some adjustments to account for the differences.

There is a newer version of the course that is currently a WIP and should be available sometime in the near future. You can also peek at this WIP through an early access link at the Tom Looman site.

Here's a link to Tom Looman's site to learn more:
